# HLIC
Vibe-coded side project (USING [SAID](https://said.haxs.dev) METHODS)
A flask server that pretends to be a Vscode fork. 
You can write code in natural language that gets interpreted by a locally running AI model, which then translates it to an actual programming language and runs it on your computer.

# How to Run
1. Have python installed
2. Have pip installed
3. dependencies to install from a terminal:
`pip install flask requests`
4. run main.py by running it into an IDE or by running in the terminal:
`python main.py`
5. visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/


# Issues
If you don't have modules installed on your computer it will probably not work.

Don't run this in public for too long since if you can access the flask webserver from a different device someone can execute code on your computer simply by writing pseudo-code into the environment.
